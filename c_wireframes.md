<h2 id="content">What is the problem?</h2>
<p>Nowadays, there’s more and more resources and designs that aim to provide a more convenient life for people with disabilities, especially in the technology field. Many inventions help them to have easier access to our community. Although we create these tools for them, there’s still barriers between the society and the people with disabilities. After having some research, we found out one of the attributes to this problem is lack of empathy, and with these barriers, even if we provide the tools which improve their physical life, they might still feel excluded from the community. Since technology is the easiest and fastest way to get people’s attention, we hope to use technology to spread positivity to other people and wish to increase the empathy by sharing their (people with disabilities) stories of how other people or the community support them. We think empathy is something that can be spreaded, so if we gather more inspiring stories and share them with a smaller range of communities such as SFSU campus, we might be able to increase the empathy within the small community, then it would be easier to keep spreading it to larger communities.</p>

		<h3>Why should we care?</h3>
		<p>In today’s time, people with disabilities require the support of others in order to function in our society. However, there are a majority of people that do not wish to help in this regard. A lot of people focus on themselves and look down upon those that require the help of others. For example, when one comes into power they want those that can be independent and can create a good environment with their surroundings. People tend to not act like their usual selves around people with disability and in turn could make those with disability feel bad about themselves. As a result, there are many negative views upon those with disabilities and that’s the reason it is hard for them to make genuine friends that do not have a disability.</p>
		<p>Currently, there are many disability services for people with disabilities. For example, people with disabilities have access to special parking and other benefits. Another example more specific to students would be the accommodations when taking courses. Students with disabilities can often talk to the professor about their situation and perhaps the professor may be willing to provide them with more time for assignments or exams. There are also many applications such as the windows ease of access, and phones that provide ease of access. These are just some examples of what we think are positive to the situation. Our technology would further improve the situation by creating a sense of empathy for people with disabilities at SFSU.</p>

		<h3>How to achieve?</h3>
		<p>Our approach is going to support a caring world, by encouraging kindness, caring, respect and many other positive qualities for people with disabilities. At the same time, our approach will discourage negative qualities against people with disabilities. In our setting, which focuses on people with disabilities, care is enacted sometimes, but there are lots of other times, when care is not being enacted. Some people with disabilities live surrounded by people that show a lot of love towards them, but there are others that encounter hate in their everyday lives. Some things that are lacking in care practices include people who are willing to care for others. There is also a lot of lack of knowledge, and misinformation. In our setting, care will be supported in the way that our audience will be able to explore the stories being displayed, and our stories will focus on promoting and portraying ways in which looking after each other can help other people happy. Our stories should motivate the audience into getting involved into performing caring for our focus group. Our focus group will be the primary beneficiaries from caring from our audience, but our stories should be able to imprint a message in the audience to care for everybody.</p>
