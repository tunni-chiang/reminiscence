<h2 id="content">Add keyboard navigation</h2>
<p>For blind and visually impaired users, navigation is a challenge. As they can’t use a mouse to browse the website, we have to incorporate keyboard navigation into our future design.</p>

<h2 id="content">Make video and multimedia accessible</h2>
<p>Videos and other multimedia elements on our website play a critical role in increasing the user-engagement on your website. While blind and visually-impaired users can’t see visuals, deaf users and those hard-of-hearing can’t hear audio.I can use an audio description to describe visuals-only parts such as images, gestures, and changes in settings, among others. It will help blind users to enjoy the video.</p>
		
<h2 id="content">Make design more consistent and simple for users with cognitive disabilities</h2>
<p>The most common type of disability by far is cognitive disabilities. There are different kinds of cognitive disabilities and variations within those different kinds. Those who have cognitive disabilities may experience limited comprehension, may be overwhelmed by complex environments, may experience difficulty reading, or may experience attention deficits. Though web accessibility standards and guidelines do not completely address cognitive disabilities, there are some design considerations we can keep in mind to enhance web experiences for people with cognitive disabilities.</p>

		<h3>Simplify the design and content</h3>
		<p>Simple designs are cleaner and less distracting, thus enabling users to focus better on the main content of the web page. As for the main content itself, simplifying the message down to its essence increases understandability. Use common words and phrases, avoid jargon, and eliminate unnecessary wording.</p>

		<h3>Keep the navigation consistent</h3>
		<p>Ensuring that navigation is consistent throughout the entire website can reduce cognitive load. When navigation is consistent, users do not have to worry about re-orienting themselves to navigate the site, or worry about solving navigation issues.</p>
