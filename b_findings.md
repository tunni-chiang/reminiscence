<p>We are interested in creating more empathy and caring towards groups with disabilities at San Francisco State University (SFSU). People with disabilities may feel left out by stereotypes that others think about them. There are definitely barriers for some people between them and society, whether it be because of misinformation, misunderstanding, or lack of empathy. People with disabilities are also a part of the community that we live in, so creating a better place for them will help us all. In this document, we will explain this problem in more depth, we will explain  the approaches that we have taken towards solving this problem, we will go over data collected from our research, and explain how we will use this data in the next steps of our project.

<h2 id="content">How did we approach the problem?</h2>
<p>We created a few mockup designs for our website, where we create posts to increase the empathy towards people with disabilities. To gather stories that we want to share, we reached out to users in various ways. We created a qualitative survey that asks general open-response questions like how are you, and also asked them to share their stories that have been meaningful to them. We also asked them for feedback regarding how to increase the empathy on SFSUâ€™s campus. We allowed them to input their email and participate in a follow up if they wanted to. We are a bit unsure of how to address the problem of accessibility for our survey and website, but we recognize the problem.

We were looking for target users via various connections. We contacted professors who we knew from current/previous classes to inform them to get responses from targeted users. We also reached out to DPRC(the organization that serves students with disabilities) and we expected the large number of people to respond(which did not happen due to privacy issues). We created a flier and posted it on the library bulletin board. We also published our survey in discord servers that we were joined to get attention from students with disabilities.

		<h3>About our participants...</h3>
		<p>A total of fourteen people participated in the survey. Few questions have less than eleven responses. There are less participants who are not interested or not willing to share their opinions. Out of all our respondents 28.6% were part of DPRC or have received help from them as shown in the pie chart below (note, our survey asked different questions for respondents who are part of DPRC or received help from them(4), and the ones that are not(10)</p>
